# C++ Practice

Welcome to the C++ Practice repository! This repository contains a variety of C++ practice exercises and projects aimed at improving your C++ programming skills. From basic concepts like constructors and enums to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming and memory management, this repository covers a wide range of C++ concepts.

## Projects and Exercises

1. **Calculator**: Implement a basic calculator program that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **CardValidator**: Create a program to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm or other validation techniques.

3. **Constructors**: Learn about constructors and how to initialize objects in C++ classes.

4. **Construct Overload**: Practice constructor overloading by creating multiple constructors with different parameter lists in a class.

5. **Enums**: Explore enumerations in C++ to define named integer constants for improved code readability and maintainability.

6. **Function Templates**: Use function templates to create generic functions that can operate on different data types.

7. **Getters & Setters**: Implement getter and setter methods in a class to encapsulate data access and ensure data integrity.

8. **Inheritance**: Understand inheritance in C++ by creating derived classes that inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.

9. **Object-oriented Programming**: Practice object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

10. **Memory Addresses**: Explore memory addresses and pointers in C++ to manipulate memory directly and efficiently.

11. **Arrays / Overloaded Functions**: Work with arrays and overloaded functions to handle multiple function definitions with the same name but different parameter lists.

12. **Structs**: Define structs in C++ to create custom data types with multiple fields that can be accessed and manipulated together.

13. **Sorting Arrays and Arrays of Structs**: Implement sorting algorithms to sort arrays and arrays of structs in ascending or descending order.

14. **User Input, Formats, Print Formats, and Imports**: Practice handling user input, formatting output, and importing external libraries in C++ programs.

15. **While Loops, Nested Loops, 2D Arrays**: Use while loops and nested loops to control program flow and manipulate two-dimensional arrays.

16. **Continue and Breaks**: Learn how to use continue and break statements to control loop iterations and terminate loops prematurely.

17. **Pointers, Memory Addresses, Const**: Gain a deeper understanding of pointers, memory addresses, and the const keyword in C++ to manage memory and prevent data modification.
